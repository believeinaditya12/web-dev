    <h1>RESEARCH AND GOAL SETTING</h1>
    <p>
     As with any project, it is important to do proper research and set goals before beginning. By setting goals, it will help the website to have a direction and will also help your business to achieve specific accomplishments. The planning and goal setting process could take about 1-2 weeks to complete. It is a very important first step to creating a website that sells. There are a few questions you should ask yourself during this phase:
     <ul>
         <li>what do I hope for my website to accomplish?</li>
         <li>Who is the audience I would like to target?</li>
         <li>What are the main goals of the website? </li>
     </ul>
    </p>
     <h1>PLANNING THE SITE</h1>
    <p>
     Planning the website involves creating a wireframe and sitemap. This is an important step because it is kind of like the skeleton of your site. This process can take about 2-6 weeks to complete. The sitemap allows the developer to get an outline of what the site will look like, what pages there will be and how they will interact with each other. This not only helps with planning but is also beneficial to the user experience.
    </p>
    <h1>DESIGNING THE LAYOUT</h1>
    <p>
        The details of the layout are what will give your website character. This is the step where you get to be creative with pictures, videos and what kinds of things the customer will notice when they come to your site. This process can take about 4-12 weeks from start to finish. The timing depends on experience, time spent on the project, and how thorough the developer is. During this step, it is especially important to keep referring back to the target audience you wish to focus on.
    </p>
     <h1> WRITING THE CONTENT</h1>
     <p>
         This step may be going on simultaneously with the other development planning steps. The written content of a website is so important to its success. While this step may be happening during other steps, it is one that is crucial and deserves a lot of expertise. It could take from 5 to 15 weeks. The written content on a website is going to help a visitor determine their next steps. It is vital to drawing customers in and keeping them. There is a lot to consider when working on the content of the website.
     </p>
     <h1>CODING THE WEBSITE</h1>
     <p>
         Now that all aspects of your website have been created, you are ready to actually begin creating the website itself. The coding typically begins with the homepage and gradually branches out to the other pages included in the site. This would be where the sitemap is followed to ensure everything is coded correctly. The coding step could take from 6 to 15 weeks, depending on how much content and how intricate you would like your website to be. It is also important to set up frameworks and CMS to make sure that everything will fit onto the server during the installation process. You wouldn’t want to do all that work only to find out it doesn’t fit.
     </p>
     <h1>TESTING AND LAUNCHING</h1>
     <p>
         Before the website is launched, it is crucial that it is tested out by real users. All the links and content should be tested to see if it works. Not only is it important to test out all the buttons and everything on the site, but it is also important to test out what users think of it. There is user testing that can be completed to make sure the website is giving users what they need to be successful on the test.
     </p>
     <h1>MAINTENANCE</h1>
     <p>
         You might think your job is done once the website is launched, but this is not the case. Since technology and products are changing more rapidly than ever before, it is important to stay up-to-date with what is happening on the internet. Maintaining a website is hard work, but the more effort put into its maintenance, the better. There are a few different pieces to website upkeep.
